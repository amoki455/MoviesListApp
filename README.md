# What does this app do?
Browse movies by category, search for movies using keywords, and view movie details.
# What API does it use?
TMDb API
# Attention Before Building !!
For security reasons I did not include the API key in this repository.
You must set MOVIES_API_KEY environment variable to your API key before building the app, otherwise you will get an error message at startup stating that the API key is not found
